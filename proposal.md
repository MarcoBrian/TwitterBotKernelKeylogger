# Proposal 


* what problem are you solving
* why is it important
* what do you plan to build
* what are your expected results.

## Problem and importance

With computers becoming ubiquitous the purpose of our project is to raise more awareness and caution when it comes to running programs in our system. Many people rarely think about what an application is doing in the background and will be satisfied as long as the application is doing what it says it will do. 

Our idea is to implement a malicious program that will run in the background of a seemingly useful application. We wanted to display the idea that the malware is “pluggable”, that we can have the malware to run in many different useful applications whether it be your fitness tracker, food calorie tracker, a game you enjoy, a money converter app, etc. 

## What we plan to build and expected results

Our take is to build a keylogger which runs in the background of an application/game and sends the keystrokes over to a designated computer system. The expected results are firstly our assumption that the user will run our program with the belief that the app is working as expected (helped them do whatever the app said it was going to do). In the background the keylogger program will run and will collect keystrokes and send them to a host. We will have an interface to view the keystrokes in a fashionable manner. 

The key lesson that we want users to take is that even if an application is performing the specified tasks there are still risks that the application can deviate from its tasks and perform malicious activity in the background.
