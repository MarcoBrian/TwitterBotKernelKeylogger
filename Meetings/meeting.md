# Meetings and milestones
We want you to meet each week as a group to coordinate with your group members. In this meeting for each member of the group you should discuss (1) what you did last week, (2) what you plan to do this week, and (3) anything you’re stuck on. These status updates should only take about 10 minutes total for the group and you should spend the remaining 20 minutes talking about some aspect of the project that needs further discussion.

One important aspect of your meeting notes is keeping track of action items and revisiting action items from previous weeks. As you meet, you’ll figure out what needs to be done, make sure that it’s clearly documented who’s doing what and make sure that you follow up about the previous week’s action items to make sure that things are getting done.

For your milestone, you will submit a doc that contains your meeting notes that includes one sentence for each person and for each of the updates (last week, this week, blocked), plus links to pull requests committed for each person and any design docs you wrote.

Design docs are an important aspect of your milestones and each group member needs to author at least one design doc and submit it to one of the three milestones.
